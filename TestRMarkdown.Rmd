The dataset is publicly available at:
combined.csv: https://data.world/dataquest/nyc-schools-data/workspace/file?filename=combined.csv
NYC school survey data for 2011: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8

We will try to answer the following questions:

Do student, teacher, and parent perceptions of NYC school quality appear to be related to demographic and academic success metrics?

Do students, teachers, and parents have similar perceptions of NYC school quality?


First, let's load the required libraries:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)

```

Let's import the data that we cleaned from the previous courses.

```{r}
combined <- read_csv("combined.csv")

```
